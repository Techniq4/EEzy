Robotic Harvester

I'm working on robotic chilli harvester. Next year I want to make a pepper farm so robot like that will make harvests faster than human. Robot must be 100% automatic (detecting fruit on plant, cutting it and give it to a box).

Project assumptions:
Driving forwards and backwards
Turning left and right
Lifting things up
Live cam
Detecting object
Front and back object detection
Maximum weight: 10kg
Maximum load weight: 5kg
Max speed: 30 km/h
GPS
Easy management
Auto generated charts
Easy charging
Long service life

Version 0.1 (18.06.2022):

Robot ARM: EEZYbotARM MK2
Driving gear: 4x6v motor
Max speed: 11.7 km/h
Arm weight: 2.6kg
Servo motor driver: PCA9685
